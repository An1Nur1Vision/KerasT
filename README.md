# CIFAR-10 IMAGE CLASSIFICATION WITH KERAS CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK TUTORIAL

## What is Keras?

"Keras is an open source neural network library written in Python and capable of running on top of either [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [CNTK](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK) or [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/). 

Use Keras if you need a deep learning libraty that:
* Allows for easy and fast prototyping
* Supports both convolutional networks and recurrent networks, as well as combinations of the two
* Runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU

Keras is compatible with Python 2.7-3.5"[1].

Since Semptember 2016, Keras is the second-fastest growing Deep Learning framework after Google's Tensorflow, and the third largest after Tensorflow and Caffe[2].

## What is Deep Learning?

"Deep Learning is the application to learning tasks of artificial neural networks(ANNs) that contain more than one hidden layer. Deep learning is part of [Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) methods based on learning data representations.
Learning can be supervised, parially supervised or unsupervised.[3]"
